# Expr Design

## Differen ways of collecting data: 

* **Sampling surveys** aim to estimate some property of a finite population without conducting a complete survey of every item in the population. 
* **Observational studies** and **experiments** aim to determine the relationship between two or more quantities in a conceptual population. The conceptual population may not exist, i.e. about future observations.

## Design and Analysis

### 1. Types of design by purpose

_Study effects of factors_ 

* Homogeneous population: Completely Randomized Design 
* Heterogenous population: Block Design, . . . 
* Crossing, nesting 

_Study variance_ 

* Random sampling design . . . 

### 2. Types of analysis 

* ANOVA, \(generalized\) linear models, \(generalized\) linear mixed effect models 
* t, F tests; Z, Chi-square tests, permutation test, contrasts 
* Power and sample size considerations 

### 3. Issues in experimental design

* Variability and uncertainty 
* Counfounding and lurking variables 
* External validity and generalizability
