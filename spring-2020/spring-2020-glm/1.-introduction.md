# 1. Introduction

## Limited dependent variables

Examples of some limited dependent variables: \(interpolation/extrapolation can be meaningless.\)

* 1. binary\(dichotomized\) variable: smokers or not, often coded 0/1 
* 2. ordinal and nominal variable: self-rated health, often coded 1/2/3/4, etc.. 
* 3. count variable: children ever born, takes only integer values 0,1,2,3,4..... 
* 4. time to event variable: survival time &gt;0
* \(5. Truncation: very big or very small sample values are excluded from the sample. \)
* \(6. Censoring: very big or very small are compressed. E.g. one's income is above $100,000, it is recorded as 100,000.\)

That's the meaning of "**generalization**".

## Generalizing linear regression

Y follows a distribution with a parameter. This parameter has a function that is directly related to X and beta:

$$
Y follows\ a\ distribution\ with\ \theta,\ 
g(\theta) = X\beta
$$

#### Logistic regression example

* distribution of Y:  binomial distribution
* parameter of distribution: p
* function of parameter: log link function 

$$
g(p) = log(\frac{p}{1-p}) = X\beta
$$

#### Poisson regression example

* distribution of Y:  poisson distribution
* parameter of distribution: lambda
* function of parameter: log link function 

$$
g(\lambda) = log(\lambda) = X\beta
$$

## Model evaluataions and diagnosis

**Deviance Statistics \(Comparing nested model\)**

$$
Deviance\ statistic= 2 (logL_{full}- log L_{model A})
$$

$$
Deviance\ statistic \sim \chi^2(n-p)
$$

* H0: Model A fits the data as well as the full model 
* Ha: Model A does not fit the data as well as the full model

```text
#LRTEST
lrtest(model.full, model.a)
```

**AIC BIC \(Cmparing not nested model\)**

$$
AIC = -2logL+2q
\\BIC = -2logL+ qlog(n)
$$
