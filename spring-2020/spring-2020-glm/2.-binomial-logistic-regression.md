# 2. Binomial - Logit & Probit

## MLE and Link Function for Logistic Regression

Method: Maximum Likelihood Estimation \(MLE\)

Three link functions:

$$
Logit: log(\frac{p}{1-p}) = X\beta
$$

$$
Probit: \Phi^{-1}(p) = X\beta,\ where\ Φ(.)\ is\ the\ cumulative\ normal\ distribution
$$

From the graph, we can observe that the trend in the middle part doesn't change too much compared to linear regression, but p is closing to 1 or 0, the g\(p\) becomes extremely large or small. 

## Odds and Odds Ratio \(OR\)

$$
odds = p/(1-p)
$$

$$
odds\ ratio (OR）= odds.a / odds.b
\\lnOR = ln(odds.a)-ln(odds.b)
$$

OR is difference.

## Interpreting logistic regression

**For model without any covariates**: we only get a intercept, from which we can calculate the p

**For model with only one covariate:** 

$$
OR=exp(\beta), \ where\ OR\ refers\ to\ X=1/X=0
\\ \beta = lnOR
$$

e.g. OR = 1.2, odds\(X=0\) = 0.5. Then odds\(X=1\) = 0.5\*1.2 = 0.6

_Understanding Effects in Logistic Regression:_ The β coefficient is interpreted as the log odds ratio-effect of X on log odds. exp\(β\) is the odds ratio, **the multiplier for odds when X changes by 1 unit, Odds changes exp\(β\) times**.

**For model with many variables:**

e.g. lnOR

* For instance, moth\_wt increases by 10 pounds, then ln\(odds\) will decrease by 0.15, odds will decrease by exp\(0.15\)? WRONG!
* Odds will become exp\(-0.15\) times original odds.
* For another example, coefficient of Black is 1.218. Then the odds of black mothers giving low birth weight is exp\(1.218\) = 3.38 times as white mothers.

e.g. OR

![](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2840%29.png)

* If other conditions are the same, the odds of having LBW baby of a Black mother is 3.38 times the odds of having LBW baby of a White mother. 
* If other conditions are the same, smoking increases the odds of having LBW baby by 136%. \(2.36-1=1.36\) 
* Odds ratio for mother's weight is 0.985, it means if a mother’s weight increases by 1 pounds, the odds of LBW reduces by nearly 1.5% \(=1-0.985\). If a mother’s weight increases by 10 pounds, the odds of LBW reduces by \(1- 0.98510\)~=14%.
* The odds of LBW for a Black smoking mother is almost eight times the odds of LBW for a white nonsmoking mother. \(3.38\*2.36=7.98\) **CAN MULTIPLY ODDS!** Since actually ln\(OR\) should be beta1 + beta2, so OR should be exp\(beta1 + beta2\) = exp\(beta1\) \* exp\(beta2\).
* When there is interaction, back to the ln\(OR\) and calculate.
* Lines of ln\(odds\) against Black should be parallel, but lines of odds may not. But their ratio should be the same as 3.38 times.（简单来说，ln\(Odds\)是减法，等距，odds是除法，等比）

## Coding

```text
model = glm(formula, data, family = binomial( link = 'logit' ))
summary(model)
# calculate OR manually
exp(model$coefficients)
# confidence interval
confint.default(model)
exp(confint.default(model))
```
