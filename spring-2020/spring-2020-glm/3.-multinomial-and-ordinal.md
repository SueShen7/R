# 3. Multinomial & Ordinal

## Multinomial outcomes

#### Relative odds

P\(neither\)=0.306, P\(mostly email\)=0.171, P\(face-to-face\)=0.258, P\(both\)=0.265 

The Odds of using ‘mostly email’ relative to ‘neither’ is P\(mostly email\)/P\(neither\)= 0.171/0.306=0.56

#### Model

Firstly we should set baseline. e.g. set the group 1 as the baseline, then

```text
res = multinom(contact~1, data=data)
```

$$
log(P_2/P_1) = \alpha_1
\\log(P_3P_1) = \alpha_2
\\log(P_4/P_1) = \alpha_3
$$

#### Predict

```text
predict(res, newdata = newdata, type = "probs")
```

#### Interpreting results

_Relative to using neither method_ :

* Older people are more likely to use face-to-face contact, young people are more likely to use email, or both methods.
* Females are more likely to use both methods than males.

## Ordinal outcomes

#### Cumulative odds

#### Assumption

“proportional odds” assumption

A \(powerful\) way to simplify the above model is to assume that the odds ratio between black and nonblack is the same for odds of any cumulative categories.

Interpreting results

* Stata/R reports the negative log odds ratio, we need to put a minus sign in front of the coefficients \(and take inverse of the reported odds ratio\). The common OR for being Black is actually exp\(-0.4\)=0.67.
* The log odds of reporting excellent health \(vs worse than excellent\) is -0.75 among nonblacks. 
* The log odds of reporting good health or better \(vs worse than good health\) is 1.27 among nonblacks.
